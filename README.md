# 1991 Indian Economic Crisis Report
This is a research-based report I completed in my first year of university, analysing the macroeconomic causes of the 1991 Indian Economic Crisis to explain the rationale behind the economic reforms that followed.
* The analysis is based on independent research, supported by macroeconomic data and institutional evidence from sources such as the World Bank and the Reserve Bank of India.

* This report was assessed at First-Class standard for its presentation, research depth, global economic analysis and overall coherence.
